# SimpleCLICalc

This project is just for learn about python modules and clases.

Nothing too complicated.

## How to execute

Just execute 

    git clone https://github.com/LSN0WM4N/SimpleCLICalc.git
    cd SimpleCLICalc
    python3 -m calc.py

You can add the folder to your python project and use it as a library

    # Python code
    from .SimpleCLICalc import Calculator

    calc = Calculator() # Defines an Calculator object
    calc.calculate(expr) # Calculate the expression passed as string
    calc.get_result() # Return the last calc.calculate result

## ðŸš€ Coming soon 
    
Maybe I'll adding history.

Add more complicated operations like sqrt and trigonometrics.
